vaccination,positive,@scottdnns @TorontoStar I work in long-term care and can assure you the high vaccination rates among staff and residents has basically stopped the pandemic in its tracks inside homes. And the amount of death last year until folks could get vaxxed was horrifying
vaccination,positive,"@adriandix For those over 12, we see 4.2 fully vaxxed ICU cases per million fully vaxxed people, and 222 unvaxxed ICU cases per million unvaxxed people; full vaccination associated with 52-fold, or 98.1% reduction in risk of ICU admission."

vaccination,negative,"@boocoupe It seems you don't understand lol.  The vaccine isn't a vaccine for starters.  If vaccinated people can still catch and transmit covid, why is the onus being put on unvaccinated people ?  Please explain how if both jabbed &amp; unjabbed present the same risk why get jabbed ?"
