Project : COVID in Canada

Overview
We want to understand the discussions currently happening around COVID in Canadian social media. Specifically, we want to know:
1. The salient topics discussed around COVID and what each topic primarily concerns
2. Relative engagement with those topics
3. How positive/negative the response to the pandemic/vaccination has been.
This repository is for conducting this analysis and discussing our findings.
